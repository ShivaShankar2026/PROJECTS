# 🛡️ Kid Watch AI — YouTube Kids Sentiment & Safety Analysis

A Django web application that analyzes YouTube video comments for sentiment and flags content that may be unsafe for children — combining NLP sentiment analysis with a child-safety keyword filter, wrapped in a YouTube-style interface.

## 📌 Project Overview

Parents and platforms struggle to know what kids are actually exposed to in video comment sections. This project:

- Takes a YouTube video URL as input
- Fetches the video and its comments via the YouTube Data API
- Runs sentiment analysis (VADER) on the video and each comment
- Runs each comment through a **child-safety keyword filter** — flagging bullying language, adult content, violence, and grooming-pattern phrases
- Displays results in a YouTube-style interface, with flagged comments automatically blurred/redacted
- Gives admins a dashboard to manage users and review aggregate sentiment trends

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 User registration with admin approval workflow (Pending → Accepted/Declined)
- 🔎 Paste any YouTube URL to analyze its comments
- 😀 Sentiment classification: Very Positive → Very Negative (VADER)
- 🛡️ Child-safety keyword filter — flags bullying, adult content, violence, and personal-info/grooming-pattern requests
- 🙈 Automatic blur/redaction of flagged comments in the UI
- 📺 YouTube-style interface — video embed, comment feed, related-videos sidebar
- 👤 User profile management with photo upload
- ⭐ In-app feedback system with its own sentiment scoring
- 📊 Admin dashboard — user management, search history, sentiment pie chart

## 🛡️ How Child-Safety Filtering Works

Every comment fetched from a YouTube video is checked against `child_safety_filter.py`, which scans for:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Bullying | insults, "nobody likes you", threats |
| Adult content | explicit/sexual terms |
| Violence | weapons, threats of harm |
| Grooming patterns | requests for personal info, "keep this secret" phrasing |

Flagged comments are **not deleted** — they're blurred in the UI with a visible "⚠ Flagged" tag and the matched category, so a supervising adult can still review them if needed, while keeping the default view child-safe.

This is a first-line, free, no-API filter. It can be extended with Google's Perspective API for deeper toxicity scoring.

## 🌐 Deployment

This project is configured to deploy on **Railway** (or Render/PythonAnywhere with adjustments):

1. Push to GitHub (already done — see repo link above)
2. Connect the repo on [railway.app](https://railway.app)
3. Add a MySQL database in the same Railway project
4. Set the environment variables listed above in Railway's dashboard
5. Railway builds using the included `Procfile`:
   ```
   web: gunicorn ytksa.wsgi --log-file --
   ```
6. Generate a public domain under Settings → Networking
