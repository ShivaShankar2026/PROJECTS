# REAL-TIME-PROJECT
# 🚦 Real-Time Traffic Density Detection using Computer Vision

A Python-based desktop application that estimates road traffic density using **Canny Edge Detection** and automatically allocates green signal timing based on detected traffic intensity.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes a traffic image using Computer Vision techniques. It detects edges using the Canny Edge Detection algorithm, counts the number of white (edge) pixels, compares them with a reference image, and allocates an appropriate traffic signal duration.

The application provides a simple GUI built with Tkinter for easy interaction.

## 📖 How It Works

1. Upload a traffic image.
2. Convert the image to grayscale.
3. Apply Gaussian smoothing.
4. Detect edges using the Canny Edge Detection algorithm.
5. Count the white pixels.
6. Compare the result with a reference image.
7. Estimate traffic density.
8. Allocate green signal timing.

## 🚥 Traffic Signal Allocation

| Traffic Density | Green Signal Time |
|-----------------|------------------:|
| Very High (≥90%) | 60 seconds |
| High (85–90%) | 50 seconds |
| Moderate (75–85%) | 40 seconds |
| Low (50–75%) | 30 seconds |
| Very Low (<50%) | 20 seconds |
